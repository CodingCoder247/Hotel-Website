The Hotel Website project exemplifies superb web design and collaborative effort. Developed within the context of a school project, this website serves as a testament to my creative flair and technical prowess, notably evident in its captivating homepage and contact us page. Centered around a fictitious hotel, the site meticulously integrates intricate details and prioritises user experience. Through this endeavor, my proficiency in Visual Studio Code, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is skillfully showcased.
